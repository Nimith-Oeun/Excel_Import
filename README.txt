**NOTE: This Project is Focused on Product Import Feature Only, not Pagination**

* This project is using pagination by default to limit the number of items displayed per page.
* This part of the code is responsible for handling pagination logic by specific parameters from api request,
  it can't reuse for other purposes.
* For the best practice of using this pagination logic, we recommend customizing the page size limit
  and data response.
* we recommend using the following: https://github.com/Nimith-Oeun/spring-Module/tree/master/jpaSpecification
